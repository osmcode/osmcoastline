OSMCoastline TODO
=================

* (optionally) check for overlapping polygons
* write out statistics to meta table
* proper warning/error checking and return codes
* make fixing of direction optional?
    * only when there are no warnings?
* determine best defaults for bbox overlap, max-points and close distance
* should create-index be the default?
* Magic number 100 in split_bbox?
* Output coastlines as lines
