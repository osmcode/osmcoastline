#
#  Disabled checks:
#
#  android-cloexec-*
#    O_CLOEXEC isn't available on Windows making this non-portable.
#
#  cert-err58-cpp
#    Rather unlikely that this is a problem.
#
#  cert-err60-cpp
#    Reports exceptions from standard library as broken.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-avoid-c-arrays
#  hicpp-avoid-c-arrays
#  modernize-avoid-c-arrays
#    Makes sense for some array, but especially for char arrays using
#    std::array isn't a good solution.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers
#  readability-magic-numbers
#    Generally good advice, but there are too many places where this is
#    useful, for instance in tests.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
#    Difficult to get by without it...
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-static-cast-downcast
#    This is needed and totally okay if we are sure about the types.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg
#    We need some of these functions at least and for some functions it isn't
#    even clear that those are vararg functions.
#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Much too strict.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference.
#
#  hicpp-no-array-decay
#    Alias for cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay.
#
#  hicpp-vararg
#    Too strict, sometimes calling vararg functions is necessary.
#
#  modernize-make-unique
#    This is a C++11 program and C++ doesn't have std::make_unique.
#
#  modernize-use-trailing-return-type
#    I am not quite that modern.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-cast
#    Old name for readability-implicit-bool-conversion.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-conversion
#    I don't think this makes the code more readable.
